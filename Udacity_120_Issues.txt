Attempting to use Python 2.7 for coursework:

First, course instructions direct students to use Python 2.7 and to make use
  of a git repo for miniprojects and final project code:
  https://github.com/udacity/ud120-projects.git

Unfortunately, there are some issues with that repo's package requirements.
  requirements.txt:
    nltk==3.2.1
    numpy==1.11.2
    scikit-learn==0.18
    scipy==0.18.1

Given these required packages, and given my use of Windows, attempting to set
  up an Anaconda environment resulted in conflicts: two cannot be installed for
  a Python 2.7 environment, and the other two are unavailable via Anaconda
  repositories for a windows 64-bit OS. Attempting to install these via 'pip'
  resulted in somewhat complicated dependency issues (long, long error
  messages) which appear to be related to Python 2.7 deprecation.

I'm sure that setting up a Python 2.7 Anaconda environment with these packages
  used to be trivial. but the best I could manage due to dependencies for other
  packages and conflicts was:
    nltk          3.2.1
    numpy         1.16.6
    scikit-learn  0.20.3
    scipy         1.2.1

For reference, here's the total output of 'conda list' for that environment,
  which includes all packages installed as dependencies for those listed just
  now:
  # packages in environment at C:\tools\Anaconda3\envs\py27:

This setup permitted completion of some small portion of the course's material,
  but by the time I got along to a portion which made generation of
  plot-windows via matplotlib necessary, popup-window	generation via 'qt'
  failed, and my patience ran out.

Maybe those matplotlib.pyplot.show() call errors were related to the versions
  of pyqt or qt and how they interacted with the IDEs I tried (Sublime, VScode,
  and I'll beg you to believe that I set up their environment usage correctly
  and have used either for many, many projects), maybe the version for sip,
  maybe any number of combinations of dependencies interacting via functools32
  backport from Python 3.2 to 2.7, since functools32 was deemed	necessary by
  the environment dependency solver.

I'm sure much of the final project for the course can be completed with a
  Python 2.7 base, and that any number of workarounds may exist for the kinds
  of errors I encountered. Troubleshooting package dependency issues does not
  appeal to me, though, and that kind of effort is necessarily outside the
  scope of the course's material.

After exploring Udacity's "Knowledge" Q&As, I came across one contracted
  mentor/project reviewer repeatedly answering questions about Python 2.7
  issues with his own issue and personal solution: since macOS Big Sur does not
  support Pthon 2.7 at all, anymore, he's made his own *unofficial* update to
  the project's codebase in order to grade students' work:
    https://medium.com/udacity-course-companion/detecting-enron-fraud-in-macos-big-sur-edd2309f7389
    https://github.com/oforero/ud120-projects/tree/python-3.8

This seemed like a good starting point for attempting to complete the
  coursework and project with a newer version of Python, as contributors to
  that repo have been updating the code to reflect changes in the libraries
  involved, mitigating a wide variety of issues cited in Udacity "Knowledge"
  questions.

Of course, there were still some issues with the packages used in that project,
  as well. He suggests creating a Python 3.8 Anaconda environment by way of
  'python-3.8.yaml', a specification file which can be used in this manner:
    'conda env create environments/python-3.8.yaml'

Unfortunately, that syntax failed for my system/OS, and I had to use:
  'conda env create f=python-3.8.yaml'
(directly from 'environments' directory of the cloned repo in this case, a path
  for the file could be passed to 'f=')

At that point, environment creation failed due to these packages not being
  available for windows 64-bit systems via Anaconda repositories:
    libcxx=10.0.0
    libedit=3.1.20191231
    libffi=3.3
    libgfortran=3.0.1
    llvm-openmp=10.0.0
    ncurses=6.2
    readline=8.0
That makes sense, given what some of those are. Removing those lines from
  python-3.8.yaml, a wide variety of package conflicts resulted, but those were
  mitigated by further removal of these lines:
    mkl=2019.4
    pip=20.3.3
    wheel=0.36.2

Removing specs for pip and wheel are basically optional, but I couldn't see any
  immediate harm from doing so, and following those changes, the environment
  could be created successfully via python-3.8.yaml.
Testing a	miniproject script that relies on generating matplotlib.pyplot.show()
  windows	resulted in successful execution, anyway.

For reference, here's the total output of 'conda list' for that environment:

Let it be known that nltk is not specified in python-3.8.yaml, and that it
  and these dependencies were installed separately:
    nltk    3.5
    click   7.1.2
    regex   2020.11.13
    tqdm    4.56.0

nltk is used in coursework as part of Lesson 11 - Text Learning, at the very
  least, so is required for completion of such.
Given the structure of the final project, natural language processing is
  optional, so nltk is not *necessarily* required if one only needs an

Working with Python 3.8-updated code:

Given my use of Windows, even after switching to a Python 3.8 version of the 
  project's code base there are some issues which may or may not be present for
  those using other OSes.
Please note that the following issues are rooted in code found "as-is",
  and that this documentation is provided only as a representation of
  errors I've encountered which appeared to be caused by code provided
  by Udacity, or otherwise converted from Python 2.7 compatibility to 3.8
  compatibility.

A multiple-location issue, file encoding treatment and end-of-line sequences
  for Pickle files results in these errors in any number of scripts where
  Pickle loads are required:
	
  "TypeError: a bytes-like object is required, not 'str'"
  Fix:
  For Python 3, the Pickle file should be opened in mode 'rb'.
	
  "UnpicklingError: the STRING opcode argument must be quoted"
  Simple search result:
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45368255/error-in-loading-pickle
  Fixes:
    If you're using VSCode, you can open the pickle file in that IDE and change
      the end-of-line sequence by way of the 'CLRF' tag in the lower right
      corner. Something similar to this method is possible in many other IDEs.
    Otherwise, anyone should be able to manually change '\r\n' to '\n' for
      each line ending via string manipulation prior to passing the data to
      pickle.load().
      (this specific method replicates "dos2unix", see page linked above for
       reference and code examples)

In parse_out_email_text.py, some errors are related to functions changing from
  python 2.7 -> 3:
  This line, present as-is in the file:
    text_string = content[1].translate(string.maketrans("", ""), string.punctuation)
  results in error:
    AttributeError: module 'string' has no attribute 'maketrans'
    Simple search result:
    	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40770018/python-attributeerror-module-string-has-no-attribute-maketrans
    Fix:
      Use str.maketrans() instead:
        text_string = content[1].translate(str.maketrans("", ""), string.punctuation)
      results in error:
        TypeError: translate() takes exactly one argument (2 given)
        Simple search result:
          https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40576845/typeerror-translate-takes-exactly-one-argument-2-given
        Fix:
          Pass string.punctuation within str.maketrans() as 'z' parameter:
            text_string = content[1].translate(str.maketrans("", "", string.punctuation))
  Mapping is then correctly passed, script operates as intended following those
    changes.

In vectorize_text.py, "file not found" error results from this looped line:
  email = open(path, "r")
This is due to paths found in from_chris.txt and from_sara.txt being incorrect:
  Lines like this:
    maildir/donohoe-t/inbox/253.
    maildir/germany-c/_sent_mail/1.
    maildir/germany-c/_sent_mail/10.
    maildir/germany-c/_sent_mail/100.
    ...(many, many filenames)
  Are incorrect, given filenames on those paths named like this:
    253_
    1_
    10_
    100_
    ...(many, many files)
  Accordingly, this issue is fixed easily by updating the paths present
    in those text files (from_chris.txt and from_sara.txt) by replacing
    each instance of '.' with '_'.

Another issue within that script, on these lines:
  pickle.dump( word_data, open("your_word_data.pkl", "w") )
  pickle.dump( from_data, open("your_email_authors.pkl", "w") )
results in error:
  TypeError: write() argument must be str, not bytes
This is similar to the previously mentioned pickle encoding issue, and
  is fixed by writing in bytes mode:
    pickle.dump( word_data, open("your_word_data.pkl", "wb") )
    pickle.dump( from_data, open("your_email_authors.pkl", "wb") )

I'm not 100% certain that no other issues may exist, but those described above
  are the ones that I've ran into.
